### Short bio

Born in Uruguay (Montevideo, 1988), I graduated in Physics from Univ. de la Rep√∫blica (Facultad de Ciencias), and in Electrical Engineering (Facultad de Ingenier√≠a). I moved to France for a PhD in Mathematics and Informatics (Univ. Joseph Fourier, 2013-2015), writing a thesis on the quantum random walk, a mathematical model of particular interest in Quantum Computing.

I'm a former post-doc researcher at VERIMAG laboratory of Universit√© Grenoble Alpes (2016-2017), a leading French research center in embedded systems that are used in diverse disciplines such as avionics/aeronautics, space, transport, automotive, telecommunications, smart cards and consumer electronics. As an Applied Mathematician, my research has to do with developing innovative numerical tools that impact decisions regarding **reliability, correctness and safety of systems.** I specialize on formal verification of **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**, **hybrid** dynamical systems, and **robustness** analysis of neural networks. 

**If you are interested to discuss, get in touch!** You can reach me at `mforets at gmail.com`.

I'm one of the lead developers of [JuliaReach](https://github.com/JuliaReach/), an open-source cutting-edge software toolbox for reachability computations of dynamical systems, with potential applications that range from correct-by-design tools, safety-critical critical systems, and  neural network controlled systems.
